### Official Documentation
* [Chrome Official Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/)
* [Mozilla Official Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) In some cases chrome extensions won't work on mozilla and other mozilla based browsers. The reasons are mostly additional permissions you need to include in your manifest.

### Cheatsheets
* [XPath cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/8c305ec8c713aad07b14) Using XPath selectors rather than the traditional CSS query selectors, helps your extension survive a little bit longer. The main problem with extensions and selectors, is that if the targeted website, decides to redesign, this will most likely break your code.
